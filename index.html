            My mission is simple - save the world by combating climate change. Without a doubt, climate change is <i>the</i> threat to our species. The elements of chaos stemming from man-made shifts in temperature and weather patterns spell out doom for all of our futures. As a species, we <i>must</i> come together to prevent our demise.

            My public projects can be found <a href="https://github.com/ivan-jaramillo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-primary">here</a>. My favorite tools to work with are Python, C++, and the principles of psychology. Oftentimes it is far easier to work with people than technology to achieve your goals. Being able to effectively communicate and being easy to work with are underrated character traits in tech. They are traits I strive for.

            It is of utmost importance for an individual to study and practice art, science, and maths. These three subjects allow us to truly appreciate the beauty of life. I attended the Chicago Academy for the Arts, the College of Wooster, and Washington University in St. Louis. These institutions of learning made me the man I am today. At the Chicago Academy for the Arts, I explored a variety of topics in theatre. The academy boosted my self-confidence, showed me that there is power in emotional vulnerability, and made me a stronger man. At the College of Wooster, I studied computer science and mathematics for my undergraduate degree. There my abilities to socialize and lead flourished. At Washington University in St. Louis, I am currently studying mechanical engineering and materials science for my graduate degree. Here my abilities to analyze and solve problems are challenged in a new way. As I go through life, I will grow as a person and adopt new skills while always being thankful to the people and institutions that taught me.
