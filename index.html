        I consider myself a student of all sciences. I'm a mechanical engineer, 
        software engineer, and scientist. I did my undergraduate at the College 
        of Wooster where I studied computer science and mathematics. I did my 
        graduate at Washington University in St. Louis where I studied 
        mechanical engineering. Right now what peaks my interest is materials 
        science, defense technology, robotics, and artificial intelligence. I 
        desperately want to improve the lives of everyone through advanced 
        robotics and advancements in energy technology.

        I've been working on my own implementation of a perceptron, a computer 
        algebra system that simplifies interesting expressions, and a small 
        robot that walks around. I've recently toyed around with recurrent 
        neural networks for natural language generation and used Francis Scott 
        Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby</i> with some interesting results. I 
        think I'll improve it later using character-level naural language 
        generation with improvements on long short-term memory.
